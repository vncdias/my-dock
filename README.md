# my-dock
A development environment with Docker, fully based on (Laradock)[laradock/laradock] project.
This is my try to building Docker containers and understanding orquestration of them.

To run, you need to have Docker 18.04 or later installed and:
- copy env-example to .env and determine your environment variables (the example contains a bunch of unused variables copied from Laradock that will be pulled off at project development pace);
- `docker-compose up` the services you need
